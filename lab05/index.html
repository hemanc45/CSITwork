      <h2>Lab 02 Reflection</h2>
      <p>Creating my first webpage at first was a little difficult, but it got easier as I worked through it. I learned how to properly structure content using HTML and started understanding how webpages are built from scratch. I used elements like headers, footers, and articles, which helped organize everything and make it look more like a real site.  I  used W3Schools and Google for my help. This lab showed me the basics of web design.</p>

      <h2>Lab 03 Reflection</h2>
      <p>In Lab 03, I learned how to use CSS to style the appearance of a webpage and make it look more polished. I used selectors like classes and IDs to target specific elements to have more control over my style. I applied CSS to the body, headings, links, and paragraphs to make the layout more organized. This lab helped me understand how HTML and CSS work together, with HTML providing the structure and CSS handling the design. I used W3Schools to explore different styling options.</p>
