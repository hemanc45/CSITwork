    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

    <p>Building this last site was challenging but also easier due to the learning in the course. I needed to go back earlier labs for the codes and re-design the to show case my pervious work on the final project, doing the labs improved me in HTML structure, CSS styling, webdesign..</p>

    <p>Testing the site different browsers like Chrome and Firefox helped me understand how important it is to work on all browsers and devices; I tested it on my computer and my phone to see if you can navigate on the site. This taught me that testing is important when coding. I also learned that file of the name matters in html and that we have to make sure the name matches the one in code because it is case sensitivity.</p>

    <p>In this course, I learned how to code HTML and CSS from scratch and to start to think and code like a web designer. I learned more about structure, design, and user experience when making a working website. The skills I learned about web developing will be useful in the future for projects/business when I need to create a webpage.</p>
