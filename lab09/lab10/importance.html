    <h2>Why is WebRTC Important?</h2>
    <p>WebRTC is important because it makes real-time communication more efficient. Most of the time, you have to download apps or plugins to make voice or video calls. But with WebRTC, you don’t need to download anything — you can get straight to communicating with less lag.</p>

    <p>It creates faster and more secure connections. WebRTC uses peer-to-peer communication, which means lower latency and higher quality. It’s also encrypted, so your data is more secure during calls and chats.</p>

    <p>Nowadays in the digital world, online and remote learning are part of daily life — and WebRTC plays a major role. It runs in the background of many apps we use today for video calls, live chats, and screen sharing, all without needing to download anything.</p>
