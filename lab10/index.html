    <h2>What is WebRTC?</h2>
    <p>WebRTC stands for Web Real-Time Communication. It's a technology that lets people talk, video call, or send messages directly through their web browsers without having to download anything like apps or extensions.</p>

    <p>WebRTC connects people directly without needing extra software, which means faster speed and less lag. It works on most browsers people use today such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.</p>

    <p>WebRTC is used on a lot of websites. If you've ever contacted live chat support, chances are they were using WebRTC. It allows real-time browser-based communication, making things like instant support quick and easy.</p>
